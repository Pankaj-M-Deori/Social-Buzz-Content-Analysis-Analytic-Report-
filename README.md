## Social-Buzz-Content-Analysis (Analytic Report)
# Overview
This Power BI report delivers actionable insights on how users engage with content on a social media platform. The goal was to help internal stakeholders at Accenture identify top-performing content categories and understand user preferences to improve content strategy. This analysis was completed as part of the Accenture Job Simulation Program, where I served as the Data Analyst, responsible for handling the entire analytics workflow, from data cleaning to interactive visualization.

# Project Objective
Accentureâ€™s internal social media team wanted a data-driven overview of which types of content perform best. The primary objective was to:

- Identify the Top 5 Content Categories with the highest aggregate popularity scores, and uncover patterns in user engagement, sentiment, and timing.

Using over 1,000 content pieces and 24,000+ user reactions, this report helps answer key business questions with clarity and precision through dynamic visuals.

# Business Questions Answered
- Which content categories generate the most engagement?

- What are the most popular types of content (such as, photo, video, GIF, audio)?

- What is the overall user sentiment toward content?
