## Social-Buzz-Content-Analysis (Analytic Report)
# Overview
This Power BI report delivers actionable insights on how users engage with content on a social media platform. The goal was to help internal stakeholders at Accenture identify top-performing content categories and understand user preferences to improve content strategy.

This analysis was completed as part of the Accenture Job Simulation Program, where I served as the Data Analyst, responsible for handling the entire analytics workflow, from data cleaning to interactive visualization.
