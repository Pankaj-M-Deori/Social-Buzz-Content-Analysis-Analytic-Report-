# Social-Buzz-Content-Engagement-Analysis-Report
## Overview
This Power BI report delivers actionable insights on how users engage with content on a social media platform. The goal was to help internal stakeholders at Accenture identify top-performing content categories and understand user preferences to improve content strategy. This analysis was completed as part of the **Accenture Job Simulation Program**, where I served as the **Data Analyst**, responsible for handling the entire analytics workflow, from data cleaning to interactive visualization.

## Project Objective
Accenture’s internal team wanted a data-driven overview of which types of content perform best. The primary objective was to identify the **Top 5 Content Categories** with the highest aggregate popularity scores, and uncover patterns in user engagement, sentiment, and timing. Using over **1,000 content pieces and 24,000+ user reactions**, this report helps answer key business questions with clarity and precision through dynamic visuals.

## Why This Project Matters ?
This project demonstrates more than just technical skills, it shows I can:

- Understand and prioritize executive goals.

- Transform raw data into insightful visuals for better story-telling.

- Present information in a way that’s easy to grasp for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

- Build end-to-end BI solutions that combine data preparation, data modeling, DAX, and designing user-friendly report layout.

## Business Questions Answered
- **Which content categories generate the most engagement?**

  - **Business Logic:** Knowing which categories are most engaging (like Animals, Science, or Food) helps Social Buzz highlight what users enjoy the most. It also helps the team promote trending topics and give content creators a better idea of what audiences want.

- **What are the most popular types of content (such as, photo, video, GIF, audio)?**

  - **Business Logic:** Some formats naturally get more engagement than others. By seeing which content types perform best, Social Buzz can improve the user experience and help creators choose the right format to connect with their audience.

- **What is the overall user sentiment toward content?**

  - **Business Logic:** Sentiment gives insight into how users feel about the content they interact with. Tracking this helps Social Buzz 
  maintain a positive vibe on the platform and spot any areas where content might not be landing well.

- **Are there specific times of day when users are more active?**

  - **Business Logic:** Timing is everything when it comes to engagement. Knowing the hours or days when users are most active can help Social Buzz and its creators post content at the right time to get more reactions and visibility.

- **How many content pieces fail to generate any engagement at all?**

  - **Business Logic:** If certain content doesn’t get any engagement, it could mean it’s not reaching the right audience or isn’t as relevant. Understanding this helps the platform improve content discovery and support creators in making better-performing posts.

## Key Insights
- **Top Categories:** **Animals, Science, Healthy Eating, Technology,** and **Food** consistently drive the highest scores and engagement.

- **Content Type:** **Photos** are the most engaging, followed by **Videos** and **GIFs**. **Audio** ranks lowest in terms of user interaction.

- **Sentiment:** Reactions are predominantly **Positive**, followed by **Negative**, and then **Neutral**.

- **Performance:** The average content score is **39.62**, and **3.8%** of posts receive zero reactions, indicating room for content optimization.

- **Peak Engagement Times:** Users are most active early in the morning **(5–9 AM)** and late at night **(10–11 PM),** with **6 AM** seeing the highest activity.

## Recommendations
- Social Buzz can feature high-performing categories like **Animals, Science, Healthy Eating, Technology** and **Food** more prominently on the homepage, explore feed, or trending sections. This helps sustain engagement by aligning the content discovery experience with what users already respond to most.

- Since **Photos** and **Videos** generate higher reactions, Social Buzz should consider updating its recommendation engine to slightly prioritize these formats. This ensures users see more engaging content and improves the overall scroll-through experience.

- With **Positive** sentiment being the most common reaction, Social Buzz can develop content filters or promote “uplifting” posts to help maintain a healthy, community-driven platform environment.

- Since users are most engaged early in the morning **(around 6 AM)** and late at night **(10–11 PM)**, Social Buzz can take advantage of these busy hours. This is a great time to schedule things like platform updates, content promotions, or even send notifications, so they reach more users when they're already online.

- Around **3.8%** of posts receive zero reactions. Social Buzz can tag this content category internally and analyze why it underperforms, whether due to content quality, timing, or visibility issues. This insight can feed back into algorithm improvements and creator feedback tools.

## Strategic Opportunity for Social Buzz
The findings from this project do more than highlight what’s working on the platform, they also reveal a chance for Social Buzz to support creators and grow the platform through a data-powered Freemium offering. Introducing a Creator Insights Program could help content creators improve their performance using platform data, while also opening up a new revenue stream for Social Buzz.

- **Free Features (available to all creators):** These features would help every creator even beginners to understand and improve their content strategy:

  - **Personalized performance insights:** Stats like top-performing content types, average reaction score, and engagement patterns over time.

  - **Posting time suggestions:** Based on peak user activity windows (like 6 AM and 10–11 PM), creators can optimize when to publish their posts.

  - **Basic content tips:** Simple, actionable suggestions like “Photos and Videos get more reactions than GIFs and Audio content.”

- **Premium Features (available through a subscription plan):** For creators who want to take their performance to the next level, the premium tier could include:

  - **Platform-wide trend reports:** Insights into which categories, formats, and sentiments are currently trending across all of Social Buzz.

  - **Competitive benchmarks:** Compare a creator’s performance to platform averages or their own historical performance.

  - **Advanced content strategy tips:** In-depth guides or personalized recommendations based on reaction type, sentiment trends, and audience behavior.

  - **Access to learning resources:** Exclusive tutorials, webinars, and expert mentorship on how to grow on the platform.

- **Why This Freemium Model Works for Social Buzz ?**
  - Boosts creator engagement by helping users improve their content.

  - Improves overall platform content quality, which attracts more users.

  - Strengthens loyalty and retention by supporting creators at all levels.
