# Social-Buzz-Content-Analysis (Analytical Report)
## Overview
This Power BI report delivers actionable insights on how users engage with content on a social media platform. The goal was to help internal stakeholders at Accenture identify top-performing content categories and understand user preferences to improve content strategy. This analysis was completed as part of the Accenture Job Simulation Program, where I served as the Data Analyst, responsible for handling the entire analytics workflow, from data cleaning to interactive visualization.

## Project Objective
Accenture’s internal team wanted a data-driven overview of which types of content perform best. The primary objective was to identify the Top 5 Content Categories with the highest aggregate popularity scores, and uncover patterns in user engagement, sentiment, and timing. Using over 1,000 content pieces and 24,000+ user reactions, this report helps answer key business questions with clarity and precision through dynamic visuals.

## Business Questions Answered
- Which content categories generate the most engagement?
  Business Logic: Understanding which categories (e.g., Animals, Science, Food) perform best helps Social Buzz spotlight trending topics, 
  guide content discovery algorithms, and inform future platform promotions. It also helps identify what users care about most.

- What are the most popular types of content (such as, photo, video, GIF, audio)?

- What is the overall user sentiment toward content?

- Are there specific times of day when users are more active?

- How many content pieces fail to generate any engagement at all?

## Key Insights
- Top Categories: Animals, Science, Healthy Eating, Technology, and Food consistently drive the highest scores and engagement.

- Content Type: Photos are the most engaging, followed by Videos and GIFs. Audio ranks lowest in terms of user interaction.

- Sentiment: Reactions are predominantly Positive, followed by Negative, then Neutral.

- Performance: The average content score is 39.62, and 3.8% of posts receive zero reactions, indicating room for content optimization.

- Peak Engagement Times: Users are most active early in the morning (5–9 AM) and late at night (10–11 PM), with 6 AM seeing the highest activity.

## Recommendations
- Focus on creating more content in the top-performing categories such as Animals, Science, Healthy Eating, Technology, and Food, since they show the strongest user engagement.

- Leverage visual contents like Photos and Videos, which consistently receive higher engagement compared to Audio and Other types.

- Schedule key posts during early morning hours (5–9 AM) and late at night (10–11 PM) to align with peak user activity.

- Investigate the 3.8% of posts with zero engagement. Review content strategy and consider experimenting with formats, headlines, or timing.

- Given that Positive sentiment dominates user reactions, continue developing uplifting or inspiring content to sustain user interest and loyalty.

## Why This Project Matters ?
This project demonstrates more than just technical skills, it shows I can:

- Understand and prioritize executive goals.

- Transform raw data into insightful visuals for better story-telling.

- Present information in a way that’s easy to grasp for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

- Build end-to-end BI solutions that combine data modeling, DAX, and designing user-friendly report layout.

## Strategic Opportunity for Social Buzz
The insights from this project not only help explain what types of content perform best, they also open the door to new revenue opportunities and ways to improve the platform experience.

Creator Growth Membership Program: Social Buzz can introduce a membership plan for content creators who want to grow faster on the platform. This plan could offer:

- Access to detailed content performance insights.

- Personalized posting suggestions based on engagement trends.

- Educational content like articles, blogs, and mentorship sessions.

- Tools to help creators improve content quality and visibility.

This would allow Social Buzz to support creators while generating additional revenue from a value-added service.

Creator Intelligence Dashboard (Future Upgrade): As the platform grows, Social Buzz could also build a self-service analytics dashboard for creators. This would provide real-time insights like:

- Which of their posts are getting the most engagement?

- What time their followers are most active?

- How sentiment changes across their recent content?

- Which formats (Photo, Video, GIF, Audio) work best for them?

A freemium model could be used, offering basic stats to all creators, with advanced insights available in a paid plan.

By investing in creator tools and learning resources, Social Buzz can improve overall content quality, increase user engagement, and create a stronger, more profitable platform.
