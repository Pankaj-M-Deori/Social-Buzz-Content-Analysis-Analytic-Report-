## Social-Buzz-Content-Analysis (Analytic Report)
# Overview
This Power BI report delivers actionable insights on how users engage with content on a social media platform. The goal was to help internal stakeholders at Accenture identify top-performing content categories and understand user preferences to improve content strategy. This analysis was completed as part of the Accenture Job Simulation Program, where I served as the Data Analyst, responsible for handling the entire analytics workflow, from data cleaning to interactive visualization.

# Project Objective
Accenture’s internal social media team wanted a data-driven overview of which types of content perform best. The primary objective was to:

- Identify the Top 5 Content Categories with the highest aggregate popularity scores, and uncover patterns in user engagement, sentiment, and timing.

Using over 1,000 content pieces and 24,000+ user reactions, this report helps answer key business questions with clarity and precision through dynamic visuals.

# Business Questions Answered
- Which content categories generate the most engagement?

- What are the most popular types of content (such as, photo, video, GIF, audio)?

- What is the overall user sentiment toward content?

- Are there specific times of day when users are more active?

- How many content pieces fail to generate any engagement at all?

# Key Insights
- Top Categories: Animals, Science, Healthy Eating, Technology, and Food consistently drive the highest scores and engagement.

- Content Type: Photos are the most engaging, followed by Videos and GIFs. Audio ranks lowest in terms of user interaction.

- Sentiment: Reactions are predominantly Positive, followed by Negative, then Neutral.

- Performance: The average content score is 39.62, and 3.8% of posts receive zero reactions, indicating room for content optimization.

- Peak Engagement Times: Users are most active early in the morning (5–9 AM) and late at night (10–11 PM), with 6 AM seeing the highest activity.

# Recommendations
- Focus on creating more content in the top-performing categories such as Animals, Science, Healthy Eating, Technology, and Food—as they show the strongest user engagement.

- Leverage visual contents like Photos and Videos, which consistently receive higher engagement compared to Audio and Other types.

- Schedule key posts during early morning hours (5–9 AM) and late at night (10–11 PM) to align with peak user activity.

- Investigate the 3.8% of posts with zero engagement. Review content strategy and consider experimenting with formats, headlines, or timing.

- Given that Positive sentiment dominates user reactions, continue developing uplifting or inspiring content to sustain user interest and loyalty.
